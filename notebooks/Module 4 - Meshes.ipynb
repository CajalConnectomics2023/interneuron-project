    "When trying to understand the fine 3d morphology of a neuron (e.g. features under 1 micron in scale), meshes are a particularly useful representation. More precisely, a mesh is a collection of vertices and faces that define a 3d surface. The exact meshes that one sees in Neuroglancer can also be loaded for analysis and visualization in other tools."

Once initialized, the MeshMeta client can be used to download meshes for a given segmentation using its root id (`seg_id`). The following code snippet shows how to download an example mesh using a directory “meshes” as the local storage folder."

    "\n",
    "Several of the most important properties are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `mesh.vertices` : An `N x 3` list of vertices and their 3d location in nanometers, where N is the number of vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `mesh.faces` : An `P x 3` list of integers, with each row specifying a triangle of connected vertex indices.\n",

    "- `mesh.graph_edges` : An `(M+M_l) x 2` list of integers, with each row specifying a pair of graph edges, which is the collection of both mesh.edges and `mesh.link_edges`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `mesh.csgraph` : A [Scipy Compressed Sparse Graph](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.csgraph.html) representation of the mesh as an `NxN` graph of vertices connected to one another using graph edges and with edge weights being the distance between vertices. This is particularly useful for computing shortest paths between vertices.\n",

    "MICrONs meshes are not generally “watertight”, a property that would enable a number of properties to be computed natively by Trimesh. Because of this, Trimesh-computed properties relating to solid forms or volumes like `mesh.volume` or `mesh.center_mass` do not have sensible values and other approaches should be taken. Unfortunately, because of the Trimesh implementation of these properties it is up to the user to be aware of this issue."
